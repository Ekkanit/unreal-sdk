# Thirdweb Unreal Engine SDK Plugin

A Code Plugin for Unreal Engine that enables developers to create thirdweb Private Key Wallets, In-App Wallets and Smart Wallets for their games and applications. The plugin provides a simple API and blueprints to interact with wallets, login with email or socials as well as create Smart Wallet session keys.

The Thirdweb Unreal Plugin is distributed as an [Unreal Marketplace Code Plugin](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/f21200c2610146f3888172994448e50d).
